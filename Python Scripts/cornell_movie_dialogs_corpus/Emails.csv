Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,
Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that

Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-
Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.

In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.
According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.
(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)
From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi
victory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.
I'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.
Yours
David

Anti-Muslim film director in hiding, following
Libya, Egypt violence
By Nia-Malika Henderson and Michelle Boorstein, Updated: Wednesday, September 12,
1:30 PM
The director of a controversial anti-Islam film has gone into hiding, according to reports, fearing reprisals over a
work that has sparked violence in Egypt and Libya and led to the deaths of four Americans.
Sam Bacile, a California real estate developer, posted a 13-minute clip of ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" in July,
and the film became a lighting rod after the Egyptian media began showing parts of it on air and dubbed
versions of the English-language film appeared on the Internet.
It depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a bumbling idiot, born out of wedlock and making up verses to the Islamic
holy book to suit his purposes and desires. The film also shows him as having intimate relations with women
and suggests that he was gay.
Any flesh-and-blood depiction of Muhammad is offensive to Muslims.
""This is a political movie,"" Bacile, 56, told the Associated Press, adding that he didn't expect the film to spark
such fury. ""The U.S. lost a lot of money and a lot of people in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're fighting
with ideas.""
Bacile identified himself to several news organizations as an Israeli-born Jew who works as a real estate
developer in California. Yet his identity remains something of a mysteryâ€”Bacile is not listed in any directories
or incorporations or real estate deeds and is not licensed in California as a real estate broker. And Israeli
authorities told the Associated Press that they don't have any records of Bacile.

There are also questions about whether the film sparked the violence in Libya, which according to some reports
seemed to be more coordinated than the protests in Egypt where some 2,000 gathered outside the U.S. Embassy
in Cairo.
The eruption of violence came around the llth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, as Americans paused
to remember the 3,000 people who lost their lives.
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were killed after protesters attacked the U.S. consulate in
Benghazi.
Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations
(CAIR), condemned both the killings and the film. Awad said in a statement:
""We urge that this ignorant attempt to provoke the religious feelings of Muslims in the Arabic-speaking world
be ignored and that its extremist producers not be given the cheap publicity they so desperately seek.
""Those who created this trashy film do not represent the people of America or the Christian faith. The only
proper response to intentional provocations such as this film is to redouble efforts to promote mutual
understanding between faiths and to marginalize extremists of all stripes.""
A controversial Florida pastor was among those promoting ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" which cost $5 million
to make and stars amateur actors, some of whom appear to be wearing make-up to darken their faces.
Bacile said that the film was backed by 100 Jewish donors, according to Bacile.
Among the promoters is Morris Sadek, who heads the National American Cooptic Assembly and the Rev. Terry
Jones, leader of a small group that holds virulently anti-Islam events.
Tuesday evening, Jones sent out a press release blaming the Muslim faith for the protests and saying the group
would be running a trailer later in the evening for the film.
The trailer was part of a one-to-two hour ""live event"" that Jones was doing from his Gainesville center for Sept.
11, said Fran Ingram, a spokeswoman for his group, Stand Up America. The whole broadcast included the
handlebar-moustached pastor in a black ""infidel"" t-shirt standing in front of a fabric lynched devil dressed in a
white turban for what they group dubbed ""International Judge Muhammed Day.""
It wasn't clear if Jones, who garnered worldwide attention in recent years with his threats to burn the Koran,
had promoted ""The Innocence of Muslims"" before the rioting began.
Asked if Jones was connected in any way with the making of the film, Ingram said she couldn't comment.

Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depth--his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.
In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.
According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.
(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head ofGadhaffs personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)
From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi

Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound
and set fire to our buildings, American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together, Four Americans
were killed, They included Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya
Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the vvorld. We condemn in the strongest
terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country
and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that

these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the
best traditions of a bold and generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed
in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more
friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined
the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people's hopes his
own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo
ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a
tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his
sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.
Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department,
he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather,
with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being
proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to
Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we arid the people
of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking indeed, I asked
myself â€” how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from
destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€” not the people or
Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were
hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post, Some
were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety.
And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort
to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free
and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until
those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities
to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies,
consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our
men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who
carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our
Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America's commitment to
religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€”there is no justification for this,
none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life
in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.

It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all
Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to
violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a
day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on
this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will remember Sean, Chris,
and their colleagues.
May God bless them, and may God bless the thousands of Americans working in every corner of the world who make
this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity â€”
the greatest force the world has ever known. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.
Thank you.

1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an intemet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddaft family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

Subject: AbZ and Hb3 on Libya and West Bank/Gaza
(SBU) I had back-to-back phone calls this morning from Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim and UAE Foreign
Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. The content was virtually identical, su esting either rare coincidence or, more
likely, an unusual level of UAE-Qatari coordination at yesterday's Arab League meeting. Main points (mostly
Libya related but one Palestinian-related) are as follows:
(SBU) No-Fly Zone: The Arab League has now called for a NFZ; the UNSC needs to act. Syria was the last hold-
out, but the resolution passed. Time is wasting. Both HbJ and AbZ made the right kind of noises (but still less
than a solid commitment) that there would be some kind of Qatari and Emirati participation in an
international effort. Their chicken-and-egg question to me was, are we going to support a NFZ? If we are,
then we can talk about the other participation.
(SBU) Recognizing the Council: Both urged us to do so. I noted that the Arab League statement fell short of
recognition. They urged us to find some kind of language that would suggest moving in that direction, and I
noted our decisions to suspend the operations of the Libyan Embassy, have S meet with Mahmoud Jibril of the
Council, and send a diplomatic representative to Benghazi. They pushed for more, with HbJ going to far as to
say that recognition of the Council will help underscore to Qadhafi and his circle that he's finished.
(SBU) Jibril meeting: They each said the same thing that Gene Cretz has picked up separately, that Jibril
doesn't want media for his meeting with S unless he feels that there will be something significant out of the
meeting. HbJ is providing a plane for Jibril to get to Paris. HbJ more than AbZ agreed with me that the
meeting itself is a significant deliverable; AbZ urged us not to be slower or quieter than France.
(SBU) West Bank/Gaza: Both reacted negatively to Israeli announcements regarding ""hundreds of houses"" in
the West Bank. They asked if we were going to say anything; I noted we were still at this point getting the
facts. ""Jeff, you guys just aren't serious,"" AbZ complained. I noted the political context, in which a family was
brutally murdered.
